# Changelog

This is the changelog file of the sw360 project. It starts with the first release being provided at eclipse/sw360. For older releases, please refer to the first project location:

https://github.com/sw360/sw360portal/releases

## sw360-8.2.0-M2

Although there are only few commits listed below for this release, the change from 8.1 to 8.2 is huge: sw360 supports now an UI which can be extended with different languages.

With the initial pull request, the English and Vietnamese languages is supported. More languages can be supported. For this, a translation file must be added. Please see `README_LANG.md` in the root level of the project directory for more details.

Many thanks to the colleagues at Toshiba for providing this big feature to the community.

### Features

* `8bd91be` feat: SW360 support multi-language update after review                                                  
* `994ad5c` feat: SW360 support multi-language                                                  

### Corrections

* `ae45236` fix(mergeUI): Provided fix for error message on merge component, release, vendor.

## sw360-8.1.0-M1

A version upgrade is justified, because of a number of new features have been integrated: FOSSology scans can be now triggered over the SW360 REST API. By this feature, an upload, for example from sw360antenna, could also trigger the FOSSology scan right away. It requires FOSSology being integrated with sw360.

Another new endpoint is the query for SHA1 values of a file to check if that attachment is actually already found at some release. With this endpoint, one would not need to search for release names and version before making a new entry, but just search for the source code attachment using its SHA1 value to check if an upload has been performed already.

A third new feature is the ability to agree on a clearing job for the software components of a project or product. A project owner can now send to a clearing expert a request to perform the clearing of software components right from SW360.

### Features

* `bb9f2ba` feat(REST): Trigger FOSSology process and check status
* `99e23dc` feat(ObligationUI): Added new status fields for Obligation
* `d025c4a` feat(rest): Attachement sha1 improvement
* `9a53e7b` feat(ProjectUI): Project Clearing Report

### Corrections

* `7bd1fd5` fix(UI/REST): Remove Trailing and leading whitespace for all fields in component, release and project
* `a2a4b16` fix(components): components listing limited to 200 entries both in UI and excel spreadseet
* `0de1db1` fix(vulerability): vulnerability view breaks at backslash in description
* `83e6f28` fix(REST): Updated upload attachment documentation

### Chores

* `1fc2e0b` Add pull request tempalte and .github folder (11 days ago) <Stephanie.Neubauer@bosch.io>

## sw360-8.0.1-M1

There is some small but very substantial bug in 8.0.0, which prevents the user from creating records in special conditions. Therefore, version 8.0.0 is deprecated and replaced by version 8.0.1.

### Corrections

* `c20fa46` fix(component/release): Add component and release error in UI

## sw360-8.0.0-M1

It is not really that we like to ignore minor releases, but release 8 is coming because:

* changes in the DB for external id handling, pls see migration script: `scripts/migrations/016_update_byExternalIds_component_view.py`
* changes in the Thrift API, allowing for SPDX BOM import pls see: `libraries/lib-datahandler/src/main/thrift/projects.thrift`

And as a larger, very important feature, there is the SPDX BOM import there in a first version, adding two modes:

* Import a project with linked releases from a SPDX BOM file
* Import a list of components and releases from a SPDX BOM file

Moreover a very important feature or fix has been provided for ensuring that malformed REST requests do not lead to failure in the application. Previously, providing wrong typed references (for example: linking releases to a project) was accepted by the application and can lead to malfunction then. The following list lists the detailed changes since 7.0.1:

### New Features

* `712ba79` feat(rest): validate the linked document ids in the payload before updating it in the DB
* `f90fcc4` feat(bomImport): implement SPDX BOM import for projects and releases
* `24999ce` feat(AddProjectReleaseRelation): add a project release relation for source code snippets
* `48de678` feat(REST): Patch Releases to Project

### Corrections

* `d34d454` fix(ReleaseUI): fixed reload report in FOSSology Process
* `336534a` fix(REST): fixed search component by external id
* `bc28c54` fix(EditReleaseUI): Fixed missing functionality of button to delete release to release relation
* `e437a5b` fix(spreadsheet-export): fixed the secuence of values based on headers
* `4c0d5c9` fix(thrift): add should return ID on duplicate
* `1d65e70` fix(html): fix minor bugs and styling
* `b7a83d6` fix(ui): saving attachment usage issue for source code bundle and others

## sw360-7.0.1-M1

After tagging 7.0.0, we found two bugs to be corrected to provide a sound SW360. Therefore, here a new tagged version of sw360. Everyone should use 7.0.1-M1 instead of 7.0.0.

Adding rolling version since last tag will prepare automated tagging with incrementing patch level, retaining manual tagging for major and minor version only.

### Corrections

* `0dcd109` fix(ProjectUI: fixed blank / non-responsive screen on project
* `da677b5` fix(ui): fix issue #762

### Infrastructure

* `a37e24d` chore(readme): adding some more badges
* `f1a7c63`feat(chore): adding rolling versions based on commit count

## sw360-7.0.0-M1

The main reason for release version 7 is to have the license upgrade from EPL-1.0 to EPL-2.0. All contributing parties have submitted their consent by e-mail and on most cases also approved the referring pull request (https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/pull/756).

Another change which justifies a major version jump is the required view update in the couchdb. Please see https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/scripts/migrations/README.md for more information when migrating from an older version. The view update allows users to configure the `My Projects` portlet.

### New Features

* `9b92795` feat(docs): relicensing from EPL-1.0 to EPL-2.0
* `66a4126` feat(Component/ReleaseUI): Added button to remove selected vendor for component and release
* `860aa3e` feat(ProjectMigration): script to migrate a project field to new value
* `bd99641` feat(REST): Add parameter to GET release by name
* `322c45d` feat(WelcomePageUI): display configurable content for guidelines on welcome page
* `abac231` feat(fossology-pull-report): Added the button to pull the already generated report from fossology
* `062c899` feat(HomePageUI): Listing of MyProjects is made configurable
* `9849cb0` feat(licenseinfo): Added filter to exclude releases based on selected relationship

### Corrections

* `2a52475` fix(ProjectUI): Show proper error msg ,when loading of project fails due to access or dependency not found
* `752bd78` fix(ProjectUI): fixed 'Project is temporarily unavailable' issue due to obligation feature
* `b32afd5` fix(ReleaseUI/REST): prevent cyclic link in release
* `0d2647d` fix(licenseinfo): White page while downloading license disclosure

### Infrastructure

* `d22aaaf` test: add script to start temporary couchdb with docker
* `df54014` chore(cleanup): drop unused and outdated code related to the codescoop integration

## sw360-6.0.0-M1

This release covers as the biggest change the new integration with the FOSSology REST API. It replaces the previous integration using an ssh login. It requires a migration of the couchdb database. More information about the scripts can be found in `scripts/migrations/README.md`.

Apart from changing the integration with FOSSology from ssh to the REST API, the entire data structure has been changed to be tool agnostic: A data structure for external tool requests replaces the info for the FOSSology upload. In future, albeit not supported today by the UI, also other tools could be integrated using the same data structure.

*Warning* Although the was much care for migrating existing data. It may happen with old datasets where source code attachments have been transferred to FOSSology using the ssh integration, the migration fails. For those datasets, the data must be changed manually. For example, just remove the status values.

*Warning* Migrations run per default in dry run mode, meaning that no changes are written to the database. After you have reviewed the changes (and checked that the scripts runs), you must change the `DRY_RUN` variable accordingly to `False`.

Two notable more features are provided by this release:

* Management for project obligations

## sw360-5.1.0-M1

This release contains a number of corrections after the Liferay Portal 7.2 CE GA1 based release has been rolled out. Therefore it contains mostly corrections for the UI. In addition to these, also the REST API endpoints were further improved. The report generation has been improved: Now, external Ids can be added to the generated documents.

Because it contains many corrections, every 5.0.0-M1 installation should be updated to this release.

## sw360-4.0.0-M1

Proudly announcing a new milestone release for SW360. We have many additions since the last release 3.3.0 in November 2018. The main reason why it turned into the 4.0.0, a major version change, was the change on the database model. According to our versioning guidelines, we have major release jumps when the DB changes. Please see below for details about how to deal with the change.

The release has the following new features:

* A first release of the project / product approval report, listing and maintaining obligations resulting from OSS use.
* Support for integration for single-sign-on and identity management server keycloak
* A lot of enhancements (new endpoints) to the REST API
* More management for using attachments (license information, source code)
* Starting to parse and show SPDX information in the Web UI
* Integration of Codescoop`s OSS library OSMAN.

### Comitters

#### Test, Documentation and Infrastructure

The most important part on the infrastructure part is the change of the thrift compile to version 0.11.0. This has an impact to all, because an update of the installed thrift compiler is required from the previous version for all machines where the sw360 projects needs to build. Note that also the ektrop lib has been updated as well as the webjars which include the Java script components for the Web UI.

* `7128acd` chore(common): Mail service sends notifications asynchronous

* `0632505` refactor(velocity): update to new version
* `6e8c349` refactor(webjars): update versions of webjars

#### Database Schema Updates

Because of changes in the couchdb schema you likely need to run a migration script. Please find more information here: `sw360/scripts/migrations/`, in summary, you will need to update in the database:

* Changes to the way how the selected licenses and resulting attachment usage information is stored leads to the need to execute `011_migrate_attachment_usages_license_info.py`.
* An identified for a todo was not used, but it was changed to title, so execute `012_migrate_todoid_to_title.py`.
